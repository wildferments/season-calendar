# regions (not implemented)

There is a possibility to add regions inside of a country. The information will get merged. The base is always the country data. If the same entry exisits in region, this particular entry will be overriden.

`calendar_{LANG_SHORT_NAME}_{REGION_SHORT}`

> Note: I restructured the code, so this part is no longer implemented.
